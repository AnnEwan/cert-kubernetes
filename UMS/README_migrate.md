# Migrate User Management Service configuration from 19.0.2 and 19.0.3 to 20.0.1


## Update the Custom Resource

To update the configuration file from 19.0.2 to 19.0.3 follow the [Migrate User Management Service configuration from 19.0.2 to 19.0.3](https://github.com/icp4a/cert-kubernetes/blob/19.0.3/UMS/README_migrate.md).

To update the configuration file from 19.0.3 to 20.0.1 you must add the parameters that were introduced in 20.0.1. Refer to [UMS parameters](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYHZ8_20.0.x/com.ibm.dba.ref/k8s_topics/ref_ums_params_ums.html), where the new configuration parameters are flagged as new in 20.0.1.
