# Uninstalling Cloud Pak for Automation 20.0.1 on Managed Red Hat OpenShift

## Delete your automation instances

You can delete your custom resource (CR) deployments by deleting the CR YAML file or the CR instance. The name of the instance is taken from the value of the `name` parameter in the CR YAML file. The following command is used to delete an instance.

```bash
Â  $ oc delete ICP4ACluster <MY-INSTANCE>
```

If you want to uninstall IBM Automation Digital Worker and unsubscribe from the IBM Business Automation Studio, you will have to scale up the  IBM Automation Digital Worker unsubscribe ReplicaSet before deleting your automation instances. Despite the pod status, as an unsubscribe success proof, you should look into the pod's log for a `STATUS=success` statement.

```bash
  $ kubectl scale replicasets <MY-INSTANCE>-adw-registry-unsubscribe --replicas=1
```

> **Note**: You can get the names of the ICP4ACluster instances with the following command:
  ```bash
    $ oc get ICP4ACluster
  ```

## Delete the operator instance and all associated automation instances

Use the [`scripts/deleteOperator.sh`](../../scripts/deleteOperator.sh) to delete all the resources that are linked to the operator.

```bash
   $ ./scripts/deleteOperator.sh
```

Verify that all the pods created with the operator are terminated and deleted.
