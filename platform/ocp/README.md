# IBM Cloud Pak for Automation 19.0.3 on Red Hat OpenShift

Red Hat OpenShift Cloud Platform 3.11 or 4.2 is the target platform for Cloud Pak for Automation 19.0.3.

The podman (Pod Manager) command in OCP 4.2 can be used to run containers outside of Kubernetes and the OpenShift command line interface. The podman tool acts as a replacement for docker with even more container management features. The two command-line interfaces are so similar that you might want to define `alias docker='podman'`.
